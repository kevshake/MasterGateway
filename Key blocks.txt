Triple DES (TDES) Key Encryption and Block Handling
1. Introduction

	You're specifically asking about Triple DES (TDES) key encryption and whether keys are split into blocks during the encryption process. Based on my research, I can provide you with detailed information about how TDES keys are structured, encrypted, and wrapped.

2. TDES Key Structure
	2.1 Basic TDES Key Format
		A Triple DES key consists of three DES keys combined:

		Key 1: 64 bits (8 bytes) - first DES key
		Key 2: 64 bits (8 bytes) - second DES key
		Key 3: 64 bits (8 bytes) - third DES key
		Total: 192 bits (24 bytes)

	2.2 Key Types
		Three-key TDES: All three keys are unique (K1 ≠ K2 ≠ K3)
		Two-key TDES: K1 = K3, K2 is different (more common, 128-bit effective strength)
	2.3 Parity Bits
		Each DES key is 64 bits but only 56 bits are used for encryption - the remaining 8 bits are parity bits (1 per byte).

3. TDES Block Size and Encryption
	3.1 TDES Block Size
		TDES operates on 64-bit (8-byte) blocks
		This is inherited from the original DES algorithm
		Data longer than 64 bits must be processed using a mode of operation (like CBC)
	3.2 How TDES Keys Are Encrypted
		Unlike AES key wrapping which splits keys into smaller blocks, TDES keys are typically encrypted as whole units using modes like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining).

		The key insight is:

			TDES itself processes data in 64-bit blocks
			When encrypting a TDES key, the entire 24-byte key is encrypted
			The CBC mode naturally handles the 64-bit block processing internally
4. TDES Key Wrapping Standards
	4.1 RFC 3217: Triple-DES Key Wrapping
		This is the most common standard for wrapping TDES keys with other TDES keys.

		Algorithm Steps:

		Prepare the key: Set odd parity for each octet of the TDES key
		Add checksum: Compute 8-byte SHA-1 checksum of the key
		Combine: Key (24 bytes) + Checksum (8 bytes) = 32 bytes total
		Encrypt: Use CBC mode with TDES to encrypt the combined data
		Post-process: Byte reversal and additional encryption for security
		
	4.2 ANSI X9.24/TR-31 Key Blocks
		These standards define structured formats for key blocks that include:

		Header with key attributes
		Encrypted key data
		Integrity check (MAC)
		The TDES key is encrypted within the key block structure, typically using CBC mode.
		
5. Block Processing During TDES Key Encryption
	5.1 How 64-bit Blocks Are Handled
		When a 24-byte TDES key is encrypted using CBC mode:

			24-byte TDES key + 8-byte checksum = 32 bytes total
			32 bytes = 4 × 64-bit blocks

		CBC mode processes these blocks sequentially:
		Block 1 (bytes 1-8)  → Encrypt → IV for next block
		Block 2 (bytes 9-16) → Encrypt → IV for next block  
		Block 3 (bytes 17-24) → Encrypt → IV for next block
		Block 4 (bytes 25-32) → Encrypt → Final block
	5.2 Why Keys Aren't Split Like AES
		AES key wrapping: Splits keys into 64-bit blocks for specialized processing
		TDES key wrapping: Uses standard block cipher modes (CBC) that handle blocks internally
		No need for manual splitting: CBC mode automatically processes data in 64-bit blocks
6. Pseudocode for TDES Key Wrapping
	6.1 RFC 3217 TDES Key Wrap Algorithm
		function wrapTDESKey(kek, tdesKey):
			// Step 1: Set odd parity for each octet in the TDES key
			cek = setOddParity(tdesKey)
			
			// Step 2: Compute 8-byte checksum using SHA-1
			icv = computeChecksum(cek)  // First 8 bytes of SHA-1 hash
			
			// Step 3: Combine key and checksum
			cekicv = cek || icv  // 24 + 8 = 32 bytes
			
			// Step 4: Generate random IV (8 bytes)
			iv = generateRandomBytes(8)
			
			// Step 5: Encrypt CEKICV in CBC mode using KEK
			temp1 = tdes_cbc_encrypt(kek, cekicv, iv)
			
			// Step 6: Prepend IV to ciphertext
			temp2 = iv || temp1
			
			// Step 7: Reverse all bytes
			temp3 = reverseBytes(temp2)
			
			// Step 8: Encrypt again with fixed IV
			final_iv = 0x4adda22c79e82105  // Fixed IV for second encryption
			wrapped_key = tdes_cbc_encrypt(kek, temp3, final_iv)
			
			return wrapped_key  // 40 bytes total
	6.2 TDES Key Unwrap Algorithm

		function unwrapTDESKey(kek, wrappedKey):
			// Step 1: Check length (must be 40 bytes)
			if length(wrappedKey) != 40:
				error("Invalid wrapped key length")
			
			// Step 2: Decrypt with fixed IV
			final_iv = 0x4adda22c79e82105
			temp3 = tdes_cbc_decrypt(kek, wrappedKey, final_iv)
			
			// Step 3: Reverse bytes
			temp2 = reverseBytes(temp3)
			
			// Step 4: Split into IV and ciphertext
			iv = temp2[0:8]      // First 8 bytes
			temp1 = temp2[8:40]  // Remaining 32 bytes
			
			// Step 5: Decrypt ciphertext
			cekicv = tdes_cbc_decrypt(kek, temp1, iv)
			
			// Step 6: Split into key and checksum
			cek = cekicv[0:24]   // First 24 bytes
			icv = cekicv[24:32]  // Last 8 bytes
			
			// Step 7: Verify checksum
			computed_icv = computeChecksum(cek)
			if icv != computed_icv:
				error("Checksum verification failed")
			
			// Step 8: Verify odd parity
			if not verifyOddParity(cek):
				error("Parity verification failed")
			
			return cek  // Return unwrapped TDES key
			
	6.3 Simplified TDES CBC Encryption (for illustration)

		function tdes_cbc_encrypt(key, plaintext, iv):
			// TDES operates on 64-bit blocks
			blocks = splitInto64BitBlocks(plaintext)
			ciphertext = empty
			current_iv = iv
			
			for each block in blocks:
				// XOR with IV (for first block) or previous ciphertext
				input_block = block XOR current_iv
				
				// Encrypt with TDES
				encrypted_block = tdes_encrypt(key, input_block)
				
				// Append to result
				ciphertext = ciphertext || encrypted_block
				
				// Current ciphertext becomes next IV
				current_iv = encrypted_block
			
			return ciphertext
		
	7. Key Points Summary
		TDES keys are 24 bytes (192 bits) consisting of three 64-bit DES keys
		TDES operates on 64-bit blocks - this is the fundamental block size
		Keys are NOT manually split like in AES key wrapping
		CBC mode handles block processing automatically - it processes the 24-byte key + checksum as four 64-bit blocks
		RFC 3217 is the standard for TDES key wrapping
		The process involves:
		Adding an integrity checksum
		Encrypting with CBC mode
		Byte reversal and additional encryption for security
